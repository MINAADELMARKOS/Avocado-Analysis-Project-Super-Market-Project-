## Differences Between Organic and Conventional Avocado

### **ORGANIC FRESH PRODUCE**
The word "organic" refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. Organic fresh produce is grown and processed without the use of conventional or synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, GMOs, sewage sludge, irradiation, artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. Organic farming is focused on creating healthy ecosystems and a healthy environment so that the crops can flourish without conventional chemicals.

Farmers who grow organic produce don't use conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds or pests. Examples of organic farming practices include:

*   **Natural fertilizers, crop rotation, and cover crops to enhance soil quality, composition and fertility**

*   **Crop rotation, mulch, and hand or mechanical weeding to manage weeds**

*   **Beneficial insects, trap crops, and crop rotation to manage insects**

*   **Cover crops and crop rotation to manage disease**



### **CONVENTIONAL FRESH PRODUCE**

Conventional fresh produce may be grown with variety of powerful chemicals to help manage fertility, pests, and diseases. This may include, but is not limited to:

*   **Use of chemical fertilizers**
*   **Use of chemical pesticides**
*   **Use of chemical weed killers**
*   **Use of genetically modified organisms which can deliver consistent crops**
*   **Production of only one or two crops in the same field per growing season or year**
